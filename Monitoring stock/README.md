# Project: Monitoring Stock

## Description
This program manages and updates a relational database about stock through a text based interface. 
This project:
- Used sqlite3 to directly interact with the database, validating the user input to avoid injection.
- Utilisied a modular approach and OOP paridigm to enable scability of the project

## Challenges
- Design of the database - Initially, the plan was for more of a normalised database, however there was little data duplicity within the records. Therefore, by simplifying it, it reduced the complexity.

## What did I learn
1. The scalability and more efficient debugging long term with a more modular approach, breaking down the original main file
2. Databases - using sqlite3 to create a relational database, although the database was a single table, this taught me through research about normalisation as well as the framework, utilising SQL queries where appropiate, handling SQL injections.
