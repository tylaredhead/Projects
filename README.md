# Projects - Tyla Redhead

 Hi, my name is Tyla and I am studying Computer Science @ University of Birmingham. A passion of mine has always been problem solving and helping others. From making my first website to my current project in software/web development, I love the ability to make a solution that can directly improve the efficiency of a process or a user. I can build a variety of applications in java and python. I am also continuing to develop my skills in Javascript as well as with the frameworks React JS and Spring Boot.

## Contents 
My projects cover a range of languages in java, python, javascript, html and css including the frameworks pygame, sqlite3, springboot and react js.

##### My current project:
My aims: Having worked with the languages and frameworks on more individual basis, I wanted to combine databases with web development to develop my understanding both with the use of a rest controller and the use of user authentication.

[Inventory management](/InventoryManagement/) - <sub>html, css, javascript, react js, java, springboot</sub>

##### Previous projects:
1. [NEA - Teaching resource for maximum flow minimum cut theorem](/NEA%20A-level/)<sub> - python, pygame</sub>
2. [Txt-based game](/Txt-based%20game/)<sub> - java</sub>
3. [Sudoku](/Sudoku/)<sub> - python, pygame</sub>

##### Smaller Projects:
1. [File management](/File%20management/)<sub> - c</sub>
2. [Monitoring stock](/Monitoring%20stock/)<sub> - python, sqlite3</sub>

#### What I learned through these projects? 
- Versatility - this is key to maximising growth and development for others and myself, enabling for more .
- Communication – recognition of the need for different approaches, energy and tone dependent on whether it is a group or individual.
- Reflection – the ability to receive construction criticism is key to my continued improvement.
