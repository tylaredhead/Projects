# Project: Sudoku using a GUI

## Description

From doing a project Euler challenge of finding solutions to sudoku, this inspired an interactive GUI where the user can solve the sudoku, competing for the fasterst time. This uses the partially completed sudoku from [problem 96](https://projecteuler.net/problem=96). The project had the following features:
- Utilised a mutil phase approach through OOP to enable three phases:
    - Phase 1: enter the players name
    - Phase 2: view and solve the sudoku 
    - Phase 3: displays the leaderboard once the problem has been solved
- Uses a backtracking algorithm
